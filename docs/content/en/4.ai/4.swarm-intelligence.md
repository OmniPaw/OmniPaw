# Swarm Intelligence

OmniPaw is built for **Multi-Agent Orchestration**. While a single agent is powerful, a "Swarm" of agents working in parallel within a shared kernel can handle exponentially more complex tasks.

## The Shared Kernel Model

In a Swarm, multiple agents live within the same kernel instance. They share the same [Security Invariants](/en/essentials/security-invariants) and [Audit Log](/en/essentials/audit-logs).

- **SharedStore**: Agents can share data through a governed memory space, allowing them to pass context without re-querying the LLM.
- **Round-Robin Scheduling**: The kernel's `Scheduler` ensures that every agent gets its "Tick" fairly, preventing any single agent from monopolizing the substrate.

## Tick Rounds

A **Tick Round** is a single pass through the entire swarm. During a round:

1.  Each agent performs one "Thought + Action" cycle.
2.  The kernel commits the resulting state change.
3.  The final state hash is calculated once all agents have finished their tick.

## Coordination Patterns

### 1. The Handoff

A "Manager Agent" breaks a task into pieces and assigns them to "Worker Agents". The Manager waits for a specific `StateHash` change before proceeding.

### 2. The Consensus Loop

Multiple agents are given the same tool-output and asked to verify its validity. The kernel only commits the state if the agents reach a quorum (e.g., 2 out of 3 agree).

## Handling Swarm Panics

If one agent in the swarm triggers a [Security Invariant](/en/essentials/security-invariants) breach, the entire kernel triggers a `PANIC`. This ensures that a single corrupted agent cannot poison the collective state of the swarm.
