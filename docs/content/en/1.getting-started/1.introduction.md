**OmniPaw** is a deterministic execution substrate designed for building and running autonomous agents with total accountability.

Unlike traditional LLM-wrapper frameworks, OmniPaw treats agent execution as a stateful operating system. Every interaction, memory mutation, and tool call is governed by a strict kernel that enables 100% deterministic replay.

## Why OmniPaw?

The biggest challenge in autonomous agent development is **unpredictability**. When an agent fails, it is often impossible to reproduce the exact state of the environment, memory, and LLM output that led to that failure. OmniPaw solves this by providing:

- **Mathematical Proof of Execution**: Every state transition is hashed and traceable.
- **Time-Travel Debugging**: Rewind agent loops to any point in the past to inspect the system state.
- **Root-Level Hardening**: Tool executions are chroot-jailed and Docker-sandboxed by default.
- **Enterprise Observability**: Integrated OpenTelemetry and real-time TUI visualization.

## The 15 Core Invariants

OmniPaw is structurally governed by **15 explicitly checked core invariants** ensuring total execution integrity mathematically. If an invariant is breached (e.g., an agent mutates an unchecked shared map), a Kernel Panic (`INVARIANT_BREACH`) forces a complete halt.
