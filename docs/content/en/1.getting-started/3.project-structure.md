# Project Structure

OmniPaw is organized into distinct layers to ensure strict isolation between the execution kernel and the host system.

## Filesystem Layout

A typical OmniPaw project follows this structure:

```text
├── .storage/               # Mutable state, logs, and Write-Ahead Logs (WAL)
├── execution/              # Core tick engine and deterministic scheduler
├── host/                   # External services (Docker, Telemetry, TUI)
├── kernel/                 # The state machine and invariant checker
├── memory/                 # Ephemeral, Persistent, and Shared memory stores
├── plugins/                # Validated third-party tool extensions
├── swarm/                  # Multi-agent coordination and consensus logic
└── tools/                  # Standard OS tools (bash, filesystem, generic)
```

## Security & Isolation

### Isolation Bounds

OmniPaw enforces isolation at three levels:

1.  **Memory Isolation**: Every agent has a unique `EphemeralStore`. Cross-agent communication must happen via the `SharedStore` and is strictly governed by the `Permissions` module.
2.  **Execution Isolation**: The `TickEngine` ensures that individual agent errors do not crash the entire kernel. Faulted agents are isolated and can be replayed for analysis.
3.  **Host Isolation**: The `ToolGate` intercepts all external calls. High-risk tools (like `bash`) are executed inside **Docker Containers** using the `DockerSandbox`.

### Permission Grants

Tools must be explicitly granted permissions in the `PermissionRegistry`. This prevents agents from scanning the host filesystem or accessing the network without authorization.

## State Management

Every state mutation in OmniPaw is:
- **Hashed**: Using deterministic SHA-256 signatures.
- **Logged**: Appended to the Write-Ahead Log matrix.
- **Verifiable**: Replayable to prove cryptographic finality.
