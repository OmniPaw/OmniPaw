# Audit Logs & Forensics

In the world of autonomous agents, "trust but verify" is the golden rule. OmniPaw provides a comprehensive **Forensic Engine** that ensures every decision made by an agent is backed by a verifiable audit trail.

Unlike standard application logs, OmniPaw's audit logs are **State-Linked**. This means every log entry is cryptographically tied to the exact state of the kernel at that moment.

## The Audit Trail

An OmniPaw audit trail consists of three primary data points for every event:

1.  **State Hash**: The SHA-256 fingerprint of the entire `AgentStore`.
2.  **Instruction**: The exact prompt or command the agent executed.
3.  **Governance Proof**: The result of the [Security Invariants](/en/essentials/security-invariants) check for that specific tick.

## Verifiable Execution Logs

Every log entry in the `omnipaw.audit.log` is structured to be machine-verifiable. This allows for automated auditing by external compliance systems.

```json [omnipaw.audit.log]
{
  "tick": 42,
  "agentId": "omni-01",
  "hash": "8f3e2b...1a",
  "action": "host.fs.write",
  "status": "GRANTED",
  "invariants": ["INV-01", "INV-12"]
}
```

## Trace Forensics

When an unexpected behavior occurs, developers can use the **Forensic Trace** to perform a post-mortem analysis.

### Identifying Divergence

If you suspect an agent was tampered with, you can run the `verify-trace` command. The kernel will re-simulate the execution and compare the generated hashes against the audit log. If a single bit differs, the system flags a `HAZARD_DIVERGENCE`.

### Time-Travel Inspection

Because the audit log contains the state hash for every tick, you can "rewind" the kernel to any historical point. This allows you to see the exact memory content that led to a specific autonomous decision.

## Visualizing Logs

Audit logs are natively visualized in the [OmniTracePreview](/en/getting-started/quickstart) component. You can scrub through the timeline of ticks and see the state hash evolve in real-time.
