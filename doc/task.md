# OmniPaw Next Steps

## 1. Actual AI Agent Application
- [ ] Build a Software Engineer Agent or Research Agent.
- [ ] Hook the `LlmBrainAdapter` to a real task inside the deterministic sandbox.

## 2. Multi-Agent Swarm Simulation
- [ ] Implement a Manager Agent to spawn Worker Agents.
- [ ] Demonstrate collaborative problem solving by securely exchanging memory layers (`INV-03`).

## 3. Advanced Host Tools (Browser & Bash)
- [ ] Build `host.system.bash` to execute shell commands securely.
- [ ] Build `host.web.browser` utilizing Puppeteer to navigate web environments.
- [ ] Hook both advanced tools directly into the deterministic replay mapping framework bounds.

## 4. Complete Invariant Test Suite
- [ ] Implement the remaining 12 system invariant breaker tests in `Jest`.
- [ ] Achieve 100% mathematical framework invulnerability structurally.
